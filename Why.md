# Why I made it this way

I decided to make this repository public because it makes things much easier from a perspective of sharing and grading.

I used the MIT liscense because I suspect that there is nothing I will do in here that makes sense to leave private, and the MIT liscense gives a large degree of freedom with use.

Originally, I had opted for a README file just so that there would already be a .md file within the repository and I could start editing, but for the future, I think I do it the normal way and stop being lazy.

@guyer Hopefully this has everything you need, if I'm missing something please let me know.

As thanks for reading all of my (questionable) decisions, here is a few fish 🐠🐠🐠🐠
